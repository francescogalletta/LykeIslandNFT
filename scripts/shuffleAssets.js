// [TODO] code to upload images, and randomly changing the naming pairs for metadata and image

// [TODO] obtain availables

// [TODO] define directories

// [TODO] take a random one out of the list

// [TODO] take a random one in the list and move it into this place. Strike that place as not available anymore (probably new list)

// Maybe I can just do, take 2 parallel structures, randomise one, and append it to the mapping. Then swap the file names
